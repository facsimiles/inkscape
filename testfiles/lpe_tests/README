This folder contains LPE to test. LPE test API has some parameters that can be helpful for fixing tests, especially legacy ones.
* inkscape:test-threshold="0.3" in the root SVG element set a precision to all the tests. If it's in a single element, add to it. If it doesn't exist, use a default one 0.0001
* inkscape:test-ignore="true" skip this element from testing
The method to create/refresh an LPE version test requires updating all LPE in a document.
The only way I found that works properly for ALL including legacy is:
1) Select Layer LPEs in layers and objects dialog
2) ungroup
3) group again
4) rename new layer to LPEs
5) delete all no layer objects at root level (become recreated)
